# 🤖 AI-ssistant Deck

**AI-ssistant Deck** is a plugin for the Steam Deck built with [Decky Loader](https://github.com/SteamDeckHomebrew/decky-loader). It allows users to ask questions to a custom AI assistant directly from their console.

## ✨ Features

- Integrated React frontend with Decky UI components
- Python backend with method bridging via Decky Loader
- Dynamic responses from AI models (OpenAI, Claude, Gemini, etc.)
- API key saving (upcoming feature)

## 🧰 Requirements

- Steam Deck with Decky Loader installed
- Python 3.x
- Node.js + pnpm (for development and building)
- TypeScript + Rollup build system

## 🚀 Manual Installation

1. Clone or download the project on your PC
2. Transfer the folder `deck-ai-assistant` to:

   ```
   /home/deck/homebrew/plugins/deck-ai-assistant
   ```

3. Restart Decky Loader:

   ```bash
   systemctl --user restart decky-loader.service
   ```

## 🛠️ Local Build Instructions

To rebuild the frontend interface from source:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm build
```

## 🧠 AI Integration

AI-ssistant Deck is designed to integrate with AI providers such as GPT-4, Gemini, or Claude. Just add your API key and the plugin will start sending live prompts and displaying intelligent responses within the UI.

## 💡 Customization
